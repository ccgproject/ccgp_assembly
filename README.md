## Overview

This repository contains scripts used for the reference genome assembly efforts of the CCGP. 

CCGP reference genomes are assembled following a protocol adapted from [Rhie et al. (2021)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03451-0). Assemblies are comprised of PacBio HiFi long read data, which is scaffolded using proximity ligation/chromatin conformation capture (HiC or OmniC) (Dovetail Genomics). Our minimum target reference genome quality is 6.7.Q40, and in most cases we expect to reach 7.C.Q50 or better (see Table 1 in [Rhie et al. (2021)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03451-0)). 

Here the overview of our current pipeline:

## Pipeline overview

There have been mulitple versions since the beginning of the project and this is an overview of how the pipeline has evolved.

Color blocks:
- Yellow: sequencing datatypes
- Dark gray: Fixed processes
- Light gray: Optional processes
- Blue: Iterative step

## Workflows

### [Pre-assembly quality control and data validation](https://github.com/ccgproject/ccgp_assembly/blob/main/workflows/preasm/README.md)

- PacBio HiFi  
    - PacBio Adapter filtering  
    - K-mer counting with meryl
    - Genome size, heterozygosity and repeat content estimation
    - Coverage validation (calculation of expected coverage given the sequencing data
- HiC/OmniC
    - Library QC with Dovetail Genomics tools
 
### [*de novo* assembly (contigging)](https://github.com/ccgproject/ccgp_assembly/tree/main/workflows/contig)

- Contig assembly with HiFiasm
    - Depending on datasets available or ploidy, we are using single or HiC mode on HiFiasm. 

### Purge haplotigs: haplotypic duplications and contig overlaps

- Alignment of HiFi data with minimap2 and purging with purge_dups

### [Scaffolding](https://github.com/ccgproject/ccgp_assembly/blob/main/workflows/scaffolding/README.md)

- Alignments with Arima Genomics Mapping Pipeline
- Scaffolding with SALSA

### Checking for misassemblies

- Generation of coverage tracks (HiFi and HiC/OmniC)
- Generation of interactive contact maps
    -  HiGlass
    -  PretextSuite

### Gap closing 

- Using YAGCloser - based on gap spanning of long reads

### Mitochondrial assembly

- Mitogenome assembly pipeline or [MitoHiFi](https://github.com/marcelauliano/MitoHiFi)

### Contamination screening

- Organelle filtering from nuclear assemblies
- Contamination screening with Blobtools 

### Metrics / stats / Others

- Contiguity metrics (contig and scaffold N50)
- BUSCO scores
- per base quality 
- Frameshift errors
- Gap description
