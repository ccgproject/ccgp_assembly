## Overview

The minimum target quality for our reference genomes is 6.7.Q40, and in most cases we expect to reach 7.C.Q50 or better (Table 1 from Rhie et al. 2021):

## per base quality / k-mer completeness 

To generate these metrics, we generate a k-mer database from the data (HiFi reads) using meryl. 
We then use the database, and the assemblies to run merqury. With this program we obtained the 
per-base quality values (or consensus quality value; QV) for the assemblies and the k-mer completeness.

As described in Rhie et al, 2020:

a) the per-base quality or consensus quality value represents:

> a log-scaled probability of error for the consensus base calls. 

b) k-mer completeness, 

> The k-mer completeness is calculated as the fraction of reliable k-mers in the read set that are also found in the assembly.
